Python Matrices is a script designed to deal with every basic matrix operation that 
non-professional user (eg. student) can throw at it. It is meant to be simple,
easy readable code with decent performance and wide variety of possible uses.

Currently supported operations are:
- matrix generation (random, identity, empty)
- matrix addition and subtraction
- matrix multiplication 
- scalar matrix multiplication
- rising matrix to given power
- computing matrix determinant (using Laplace's formula)

This repository serves as PyCharm project to make changes easier.
Please, if you find any errors or lack of certain important fonctionality, create an issue.
Feel free to contribute :)
